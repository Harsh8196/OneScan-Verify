## The Problem
In this day and age, can we trust any documents presented to us? How do you know if a document is real or fake? Forgery software is readily available and makes manipulation easy. For example, any diploma /degree document forged online and we don't have any information about it. Like, wise any other government certificate like Birth, death or marriage easily forged by anyone on the internet.
